A format string is a string whose contents are determined dynamically at runtime. 
Format strings are created by embedding *interpolated expressions* or placeholders inside of braces within a string. 
Everything inside the braces (`{...}`) will be resolved to a value and output as a formatted string at runtime. 
There are two methods to create format strings: string interpolation and composite formatting.

 ### String Interpolation
Available in C# 6.0 and later, [*interpolated strings*](../../language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md) are identified 
by the `$` special character and include interpolated expressions in braces. If you are new to string interpolation, 
see the [String interpolation - C# interactive tutorial](../../tutorials/intro-to-csharp/interpolated-strings.yml) for 
a quick overview.

 Use string interpolation to improve the readability and maintainability of your code. 
 String interpolation achieves the same results as the `String.Format` method, but improves ease of use and inline clarity.
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideFormatStrings](~/samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/strings/Strings_1.cs#StringInterpolation)]

 ### Composite Formatting
The <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> utilizes placeholders in braces to create a format string. 
This example results in similar output to the string interpolation method used above.
