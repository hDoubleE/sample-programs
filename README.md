# C# Sample Programs

This repo contains C# "sample programs" for school. They're simple programs made to do simple things.

They're supposed to be sourced from elsewhere to ensure functionality. I had a hard time with that so I wrote some myself.

The code contains a ton of comments because that was the assignment. The comments are there to prove understanding.

Feel free to check em out and do whatever you want with it.

Topics Include:

#### Printing funny things to Console
#### String Manipulation
#### OOP principles
#### Linked Lists
#### Fibonacci
#### Factorial
##### etc...

Best.
